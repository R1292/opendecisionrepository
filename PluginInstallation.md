# Introduction #
Installing the plug-in is quite simple. We provide an automatic installer which should work in most cases. However, should this not succeed you can always install it manually.


# Automatic installation #
## Linux/OSX ##
Installing for Linux and OSX is made easy using a shell script, if it does not work, please use the manual installation guide (see the following section).
  * Download the following shell script from [our download mirror](http://dl.decisionrepository.com/).
  * Make it executable using _chmod +x odr-plugin-installer.sh_
  * Run it _./odr-plugin-installer.sh_

If it does not work, please add an issue to our [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/opendecisionrepository/issues/list). In order to resolve the problem, please state clearly which OS system you are using and the error you encountered.

## Windows ##
For now please refer to the manual installation steps below.

# Manual #
Use the manual installation if the automatic one fails or if you prefer to do it manually.

  * Dowload the plug-in .zip package from [our download mirror](http://dl.decisionrepository.com/).
  * Find your Visual Paradigm installation, e.g., _C:\Program Files\Visual Paradigm, /opt/VP\_Suite, /usr/local/VP\_Suite_.
  * Make a directory called _plugins_ in the Visual Paradigm folder.
  * Extract the zip package so that you have _Visual Paradigm/plugins/ODR_.
